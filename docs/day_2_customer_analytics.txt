========================================

🎯 OBJECTIVE
- Build and run first SQL project against Postgres
- Capture results of core analytics queries
- Commit artifacts to GitHub portfolio

📝 TASKS
1. Confirm Postgres service running and connect to de_portfolio
2. Create schema "da" and table "ecommerce_sales"
3. Load ecommerce_sales_sample.csv into da.ecommerce_sales
4. Run analysis queries:
   - Top 10 customers by total spend
   - Monthly revenue trend
   - Repeat buyers
5. Export results as CSV files
6. Save queries into queries.sql
7. Commit CSV + SQL files to repo

💻 COMMANDS / CODE

# PostgreSQL
\c de_portfolio
\dn
\dt da.*
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM da.ecommerce_sales;

-- Top 10 customers
SELECT CustomerID,
       ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity)::numeric, 2) AS total_spent
FROM da.ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Monthly trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', InvoiceDate) AS month,
       ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity)::numeric, 2) AS revenue
FROM da.ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

-- Repeat buyers
SELECT CustomerID,
       COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS orders
FROM da.ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) > 1
ORDER BY orders DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Bash (export results)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U "$USER" -d de_portfolio -c "COPY (...query...) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;" > projects/sql/customer_analytics/[filename].csv

# Git
git add projects/sql/customer_analytics/*.csv projects/sql/customer_analytics/queries.sql
git commit -m "Day 2: Customer Analytics queries + results"
git push
